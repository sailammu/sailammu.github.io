<h><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
<p> Sound is something which plays an vital role in our lives.We hear a different kind of sounds
in our day to day life,which helps us to communicate with one another.For example all the musical
instruments which produces sounds,school bell,vehicle horn etc.</p>

<h2><strong>Sound Produced By Humans</strong></h2>
<p> Sound is produced by human beings too while singing,talking etc.The sound which is produced by us
is actually produced from the <em>voice box</em> or the <em>larynx</em>.The larynx contains two <em>
vocal cords</em> which is stretched to create a narrow path so that air can enter through it.When the
air will go through slit,the vocal cords vibrate and end up with producing sound.</p>

<h3><strong>Sound Needs a Medium for Propagation</strong></h3>
<p>Sound needs a medium to travel.First lets see what happens in case of vacuum.Where there will be an absence
of air or air has been removed completely is known as vacuum,so sound cannot travel through a vacuum.Now
whereas in case of solid and liquid sound can travel through it.</p>

<h4><strong>We hear Sound through ours Ears</strong></h4>
<p>As we all know we hear sound through ears.When sound enters through our ears,it travels deep down inside our
ears and where it end up in a thin stretched membrane known as <em>eardrum</em>.Actually our ears are connected
with brains.Lets see how?The eardrum is like a stretched rubber sheet.The vibration which is produced by sound
makes the eardrum vibrate.The vibrations from the eardrum travels to the inner ear,from there the signal goes to 
the brain.That is how we hear sound.</p>

<h5><strong>Amplitude,Time Period and Frequency of a Vibration</strong></h5>
<p>Oscillatory motion can be defined as the to and fro movement of an object from its mean position.The no.of
oscillations per second is called the <em>frequency</em> of oscillation.It is expressed in <em>hertz or hz</em>.
The frequency of 1 hz is one oscillation per second,Amplitude and frequency are the two important properties
of any sound.</p>

<h6><strong>Loudness and Pitch</strong></h6>
<p>Pitch is the frequency which decides the quality of a sound.If the vibration is higher,we say the the sound
is shrill and it will have high pitch too.If the frequency of vibration is lower,then we say that the sound has a
lower pitch.</p>

<h7><strong>Audible and Inaudible Sounds</strong></h7>
<p>We humans have some specific limit to hear the sound.We human beings cannot hear any sound which is less than 
20hz nor we cannot hear more than 20,000hz,which is known to be <em>inaudible sounds</em>.Thus for us the hearing
capability range is from 20hz to 20,000hz only.</p>

<h8><strong>Noise pollution</strong></h8>
<p>The presence of unpleasant and unnecessary sounds in the surrounding is called noise pollution.For example horn
of vehicles,loudspeakers,sounds of machines,telly,radio etc all cause noise pollution.This can lead to health related
problems like hypertension,lack of sleep and so on.It can also cause a person's ears to permenantly damage the ears.
To control this, all noisy industries should be shifted far from commercial areas,people should minimise the use of
horns in vehicles.TV and all speakers should be run at low volume.</p>
